# Welcome to MDX!

This is a **test post** written in *MDX format*. Let's see if all our components work properly.

## Code Example

Here's some TypeScript code:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const message = greet("World");
console.log(message);
```

## Lists

Here are some features:

- **MDX Support**: We can now use React components in markdown
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks are highlighted with Shiki
- **Custom Components**: All markdown elements use our custom styled components
- **Type Safety**: Everything is properly typed with TypeScript

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Blockquote

> This is a blockquote to test our styling. It should have a nice border and proper formatting.
