title: "Another Portfolio (and small intro to bun)"

I've done it again: another, new, minimalistic portfolio. It's my fourth portfolio, and for sure not the last one. I could surf for hours online, searching for a new trend, and implementing it (a trend, which I probably never finish ðŸ’€). This post is about how I createad this website, why I created this website and about [bun](https://bun.com).

This time, I've tried to be as minimalistic as possible â€“ not only with the design, but also with the code. I used [bun](https://bun.com) as a kind of replacement for nodejs and express. I just need to import the `serve` function from bun, and whoosh, I have a completed web-server, with routing, replacing a framework like nextjs.

```tsx
import { serve } from 'bun';
import { renderToReadableStream } from 'react-dom/server';

function Home() {
    return (
        <p>Hello World</p>
    )
}

const server = serve({
  port: 3000,
  routes: {
    '/': async () => {
      const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<Home />);
      return new Response(stream, {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' },
      });
    },
  },
});
```

This is an example of an basic website (like really, really basic), which is completely functional, uses react and renders on the server. It's not reactive (you can't add onClick handlers to buttons for example), but we don't need that for the simple portfolio. 

I've made an list, what I really need for my portfolio:
- a blog
- good seo
- minimalistic design

The blog is probably the hardest part on the entire project, I need to display not only the markdown articles, but also a list of the articles and the metadata of the articles. With that in mind, I've added to my server the following route:

```tsx
const server = Bun.serve({
    routes: 
        '/blog/*': async (req) => {
            const params = new URL(req.url).pathname;
            const blogUrl = params.split('/').reverse()[0];

            const blog = await loadBlog();

            const article = blog.get(blogUrl);

            if (!article) {
                return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 });
            }

            const stream = await renderToReadableStream(
                <Blog article={{ ...article, slug: blogUrl }} />
            );

            return new Response(stream, {
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'text/html',
                }
            });
        },
    }
})
```
